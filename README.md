# Isolated feature development

This is an example app which demonstrated how new feature can be developed
in isolation by using a "Slot-Fill" pattern

## How to run the app

1. Make sure you have `node` and `npm` installed. [Installation instructions](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)

2. Install dependencies.  
Inside the app folder, run:
    ```
    npm install
    ```

3. Run locally
    ```
    npm start
    ```
    Open your browser (default url is `localhost:1234`).
